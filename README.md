# Abstract

With the increasing cases of automobile accidents, the measure of casualties is increasing.
Due to the absence of any mechanism, that could act promptly at the time of the accident the injuries
are turning to casualties. To reduce the number of casualties in road accidents our project introduces a
way to prompt an alert about the happening and we can expect a prompter response from emergency
services.

# Accident Detection

As the name, Automatic Car Accident Detection and Tracking, suggests before sending the alert, there are two primary operations: accident detection and tracking the spot. The former is conducted under the assistance of sensors and microcontroller (Arduino) and the later is dealt with the help of GPS.

# Components Used

- Arduino Uno 
- Node MCU
- Flexi Force Sensor
- Collision Sensor
- Vibration Sensor
- RC Car
- GPS 
- GSM Moduel
